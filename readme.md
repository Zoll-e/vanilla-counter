# Vanilla Counter! 🍦🍨

## Description:

This is a 1 millionth ~~*Hello World!*~~  counter app. Why did I do it then you may wonder, well it was time for me to learn framework-agnostic javascript in depth. Click [here](https://zoll-e.github.io/vanilla-counter/) to check it on github pages.

## What did I learn:
> State management using the observer design pattern

> DOM manipulation with pure javascript

> Conditional rendering

> Browser Event handling

> Application lifecycle

> Modularization with classes

---

## Key takeaways for me

JS frameworks solves lot of problems, but they may introduce technical overhead, looking at you react...

The choice depends solely on the situation and the problem we have to tackle, like everything else in web development.
